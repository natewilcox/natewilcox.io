                        I have developed a fun and educational app that teaches
                        programming to children. With this app, kids can guide a
                        car to its target location by selecting commands, such
                        as \"move forward\", \"turn left\" or \"turn right\".
                        The game requires logic and problem-solving skills as
                        players must navigate obstacles and avoid pitfalls to
                        reach their goal. Through this app, my daughter has
                        learned programming concepts such as loops, conditionals
                        and sequencing in a fun and interactive way. With its
                        colorful graphics, engaging gameplay and educational
                        benefits, this app is perfect for any child who wants to
                        learn the basics of programming.

                        This online battle royale game brings together the
                        thrilling gameplay of a battle royale with the beloved
                        characters and art style of Legend of Zelda. Set in the
                        fantastical world of Hyrule, players battle it out to be
                        the last one standing using an array of weapons, items,
                        and abilities from the iconic franchise.

                    <p>
                        In Dungeon Crawler, players will take on the role of a
                        patient trying to escape a hospital before their torch
                        goes out. The game will be played in a top-down
                        perspective and will feature simple controls for
                        movement and limited combat options. Players will need
                        to navigate through the dungeon, avoiding enemies and
                        collecting loot along the way while keeping an eye on
                        their torch's remaining time. If the hero's torch runs
                        out of fuel, the hero will die as monsters lurking in
                        the shadows will attack.
